            I was initially happy about the virus because there was a lockdown all over India, there were
            no schools and colleges, had an ash life initially enjoying all the day with playing games, watching movies
            right from the morning to the night. Initially Online classes also feel better. Finally came to know that
            this virus is not a blessing to students but a foreshadow of the student’s further life. I was not able to
            physically meet my friends and hangout which made me socially weak. But I gave an ample amount of time to
            try new things like craft, web development etc. Try out the things you love and soon we will be back to our
            normal life.

            I didn't take COVID very seriously at first. I just thought it affected only Wuhan, a city in
            China. Although, I was happy that I spent quality time with my family members but, as the days passed, I
            felt angry, sad, hopeless, bored, and trapped. To overcome the situation, I explored new things in this
            pandemic like cooking food, drawing and also improved my communication skills, so I managed the time as
            fruitfully as possible. At last, "Stay Home, Stay Safe!".

            Throughout the months of March and April, those had to be one of the toughest times of my life.
            So many changes had to be made in life in order to keep us all safe. I had to do college online, but the
            worst part was not being able to see my friends and family. So many drastic changes were occurring, it
            eventually took a toll on my mental health. In order to cope with my emotions, my family and I started to
            take long walks, I would sing/listen to my favourite songs, and my sister and I would always binge watch our
            favourite shows and movies on Netflix. I hope that this tough situation will eventually pass and we will be
            back to our normal life.

            When the lockdown started, I was ecstatic. The novelty of being at home wore off and I started
            to struggle. I had nightmares most nights, and struggled to sleep. It was as if I was stuck, trapped in my
            house and in my own head. However, over time, I found ways to deal with the pressure. I realised that
            lockdown gave me more time to the things I loved, and also, I started spending more time with my family. All
            we can do right now is stay at home, look after ourselves and our loved ones, and look forward to a better
            future.
